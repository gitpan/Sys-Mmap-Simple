Sys::Mmap::Simple

This module maps files to Perl variables. There are a few differences between this module and Sys::Mmap.

* It offers a more simple interface. It always maps the whole file, and always does shared mapping. This seems to be what people want in 95% of all cases.
* It is portable, supporting not only unix but also windows.
* This module is safe yet fast. Sys::Mmap offers two interfaces, one is fast, but can segfault if not used correctly. The other is safe, but reportedly 10 times slower. Sys::Mmap::Simple is fast (as long as it is used properly) and safe.
* It will automatically unmap the file when the scalar gets destroyed.
* It has built-in support for thread synchronization.

This is an early release. There are likely to be bugs. Also I can't guarantee API stability yet.
