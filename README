Sys::Mmap::Simple

This module maps files to perl variables. There are a few differences between this module and Sys::Mmap.
 * It will automatically unmap the file when the scalar gets destroyed.
 * This module is safe yet fast. Sys::Mmap offers two interfaces, one throwing segfaults when used improperly, the other (based on ties) is safe
but reportedly 10 times slower. Sys::Mmap::Simple will give a friendly warning when doing something wrong, but when properly used it isnâ€™t any
slower that any other string.
 * It always maps the whole file, and always does shared mapping. This seems to be what people want in 95% of all cases.

This is an early release. There are likely to be bugs.
